# Avant Arte - Developer Challenge



Thank you so much for taking the time to participate in our developer challenge. 

The challenge has two parts:

1) A [task](#task) to replicate a basic verison of our works page.

2) Some  [follow-up questions](./FOLLOW-UP.md) 

----

Your sollution will be evaluated on the following:

* Your implementation works as described in the [task](#task).

* Your solution looks like the provided [design](#design).

----

## Task

We have placed a number of helpful todos inside the code (see `index.js` and `App.jsx`) to help get you started, the main items we are looking for are:

- Fetch works from the provided `works.json` and format them into client readable results.
- Use the returned data to display a page of works that matches the given design.
  - Prices should be displayed in euros.
- Display tags based on the following rules.
  - Given a Soldout tag is provided then the product should display a sold out tag.
  - Given a Coming soon tag is provided and a soldout tag is not provided then the product should display a coming soon tag
  - Given a availble tag is provided and no other tags are provided then the product should show no tag.



## Design

We've provided a [design](./designs/listings.png) for small screens (480px). For this exersize **please don't worry about tackling larger breakpoints** . Please just make sure your solution looks good at 480px in portrait orientation.

We have provided some basic sass variables to help you get you started in [variables.scss](./src/styles/variables.scss).


## Client implementation

We'd like you to use [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). On top of that, use whatever front-end libraries you feel comfortable with.

We've set you up with a build of Facebook's [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

We've wired in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) with some base styles.

## Works results

The provided `works.json` which will return a collection of works:

* **[Integer]id** - The unique Id of a product
* **[String]title** - The display title of the product
* **[Array]tags** - An array of product tag strings
* **[String]image** - An absolute url for the product image
* **[String]url** - An absolute url for the product 
* **[Float]price** - Float number representation of price 



## Running the project

There are the following commands availble to run the project 

* `npm start` - This will start the application for development
* `npm run build` - Will create a production optimised build
* `npm test` - Will run the front end tests

## Submission Guide

* The zip file should be named {yourname}.zip, and should itself contain the developer-challenge project folder with your submission.


* The zip file should contain the [FOLLOW-UP.md](./FOLLOW-UP.md) file with answers to the follow-up questions.

* The zip file should **not** include the `node_modules` folder.
